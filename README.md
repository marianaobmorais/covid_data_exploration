# Vaccination saves lives: COVID-19 case study
This case study on COVID-19 was based on Alex Frebergâ€™s Data Analyst Portfolio Project Tutorial for SQL and Tableau.
After watching the tutorial, I decided to explore the data on COVID-19 and do my own data explorations.
In this case study I use SQL notions of windowing functions, rolling numbers, extract from date, subqueries, aggregation functions.

## Business task
Vaccination saves lives: how the rise of vaccination decreased the number of infections and deaths by COVID-19.
It is expected that the rise of vaccination will decrease the infection and death rates.

## Data source
COVID-19 Data Explorer (WHO COVID-19 Dashboard. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2020, dataset downloaded through ourworldindata.org) contains raw data on confirmed COIVD-19 cases and deaths worldwide.
The data includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing. This dataset was generated by WHO COVID-19  Dashboard between January, 3rd 2020 and August, 30th 2023.
Datasets: I split the COVID-19 dataset into 2 CSV files in order to perform JOIN functions using SQL: covid_deaths.csv and covid_vaccination.csv

## Data exploration

The data exploration was done using PostgreSQL.
The code can be seen here.

## Visualizations

The data visualization was done using Tableau. See the original dashboard here.
