# Vaccination saves lives: COVID-19 in Europe case study
This case study on COVID-19 was based on [Alex Freberg’s Data Analyst Portfolio Project](https://youtu.be/qfyynHBFOsM?si=NCAmQc_-GDOsZLSz) for SQL and Tableau. After watching the tutorial, I decided to explore the data and do my own case study.  
In this case study, I use SQL notions of **window functions, rolling numbers, extract from date, subqueries, aggregation functions**.

## Business task
**Vaccination saves lives**: how does the rise of vaccination correlate with the number of infections and deaths by COVID-19? 

It is expected that the rise of vaccination will decrease the infection and death rates.

## Data source
**[COVID-19 Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&facet=none&country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false)** (WHO COVID-19 Dashboard. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2020, dataset downloaded through [ourworldindata.org](ourworldindata.org) contains raw data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide.
The data includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing. This dataset was generated by WHO COVID-19 Dashboard between **January 3rd, 2020** and **August 25th, 2023**.  


## Data exploration

In order to get insights on the data, I need to analyse the datasets and identify the correlation between vaccination and infections and deaths.  
I will explore the following questions:  

- What is the likelihood of being infected and likelihood of dying once infected per continent?
- How did the infection and deaths count change between January 2020 and August 2023 per country?
- What is the total death count per continent?
- What is the percentage of population who has recieved at least one COVID-19 vaccine?
- How have the global death count changed after vaccination started?


The data exploration was done using **PostgreSQL**.
The codes I wrote to answer the questions above can be seen [here](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/covid_data_exploration/blob/main/covid_data_exploration.sql).  

**Datasets**:  

I split the COVID-19 dataset into two .csv files in order to perform JOIN functions using SQL: covid_deaths.csv and covid_vaccination.csv (this could have been done with self join too, but since the original dataset has too many rows, I decided to follow Alex Freberg's recommendation and split it into two)

## Visualizations

The data visualization was done using **Tableau**. See the original dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_16946533694530/Dashboard1?:language=pt-BR&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

### Key findings:
1. **Europe** is the continent with the **highest average infection percentage (17,01%)** and the **highest average deaths per case percentage (48,58%)**.
2. The peak of death count in Europe happened in the week of January 17th, 2021 (**39.750 deaths**), and the vaccination started as of the week of December 6th, 2020.  The vaccination count peaked in the week of June 20th, 2021; in the same week, the **death count reached the low of 6.058 deaths**, which was the lowest mark since July, 2020.
3. It is important to point out that the vaccine protection increases in the days following the dose. According to the [Australian Department of Health and Age Care](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/is-it-true/is-it-true-how-long-does-it-take-for-the-vaccines-to-work), the "best protection until 7–14 days after the final dose recommended for your age group or individual health needs", that is why I decided to filter the **date by weeks**.
4. The **death rate "comes in waves"** marking almost opposite symmetrical high and low points. Since June, 2022, the range of waves are smaller and the weekly death count is under 7.000 deaths for the rest of the year of 2022.
5. The European country with the highest vaccination rate is Gibraltar with **406,43% of the population vaccinated**, whereas the country with the highest vaccination count is Germany with **192.221.468 total shots**.
6. The average vaccination rate peaked in the week of February 13th, 2022 marking **111,6%**, which means on average more than 100% of the european population got vaccinated that day - could it had been tourists or people outside the census? Answering this would require more data.

### A few other questions

Some other questions that came along while I was doing the analysis that would require more data or a different business task:

- How often and how long were the lockdowns in each country?
- How does the population density correlates with the death rate?
- How does the vaccination and testing correlates with the GPD per capita?
