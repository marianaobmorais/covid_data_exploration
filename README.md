# Vaccination saves lives: COVID-19 case study
This case study on COVID-19 was based on [Alex Frebergâ€™s Data Analyst Portfolio Project](https://youtu.be/qfyynHBFOsM?si=NCAmQc_-GDOsZLSz) for SQL and Tableau.
After watching the tutorial, I decided to dive in the data on COVID-19 and do my own explorations.
In this case study, I use SQL notions of **window functions, rolling numbers, extract from date, subqueries, aggregation functions**.

## Business task
**Vaccination saves lives**: how the rise of vaccination decreased the number of infections and deaths by COVID-19.  
It is expected that the rise of vaccination will decrease the infection and death rates.

## Data source
**COVID-19 Data Explorer** (WHO COVID-19 Dashboard. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2020, dataset downloaded through [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&facet=none&country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false)) contains raw data on confirmed COIVD-19 cases and deaths worldwide.
The data includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing. This dataset was generated by WHO COVID-19 Dashboard between **January 3rd, 2020** and **August 30th, 2023**.  
Datasets: I split the COVID-19 dataset into 2 CSV files in order to perform JOIN functions using SQL: covid_deaths.csv and covid_vaccination.csv

## Data exploration

The data exploration was done using **PostgreSQL**.
The code can be seen [here](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/covid_data_exploration/blob/main/covid_data_exploration.sql).

## Visualizations

The data visualization was done using **Tableau**. See the original dashboard here.
